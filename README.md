### Functional Requirements

1. Arithmetic Operations
    * The calculator must support addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
    * All operations are performed on hexadecimal numbers (base 16).
    * The calculator should return valid results for all operations within the defined constraints.

2. Inputting values
    * Only hexadecimal numbers (0-9, A-F) should be accepted as input.
    * Each operand must be limited to a maximum of 2 digits.
    * Any invalid input should be rejected with an appropriate error message.

3. Outputting Values

    * The result should be a valid hexadecimal number.
    * The result must be limited to a maximum of 4 digits.
    * No negative results should be produced; subtraction should always return non-negative values.
    * No decimal values should appear in the result.

4. User Interface

    * A simple, user-friendly interface should be provided.
    * Users should be able to input values via a graphical interface or command line.
    * A display area should show both input values and results.

5. Errors

    * If an invalid input is entered, an error message should be displayed.
    * If a division by zero occurs, an appropriate error message should be returned.
    * If a result exceeds 4 digits, it should be capped, and an error message should be displayed.
